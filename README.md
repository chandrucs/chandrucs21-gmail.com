The base idea behind implementing RFID Based Toll System is to automate the toll collection process and their by reducing manual operation in toll booths and the long queues at toll booths using RFID tags installed on the vehicles. In addition to this, project helps the vehicle owners for vehicle theft detection, fee deduction at various toll booths. Helps the system administrators to track vehicles, check level of traffic in roads, analysis of day wise fee collection, month wise fee collection, year wise fee collection and also can track over speeding vehicles, and crossing the signals.
This system can also be used at Shopping Centers for Car Parking fee collection, which will reduce the manual operation.
Most important points regarding to purpose behind choosing this project and what the requirement of this type of project is in our day to day life.
 Saving of time in collecting toll.
 Avoid financial loss.
 To monitor the traffic.
 Avoid the fuel loss.
 SMS Notification regarding deduction
 Tracking of over speed vehicles
 Checking of traveling history of vehicles
 Collected toll fee analysis
 Shopping Centers Car Parking fee collection
From all these observations, following objectives are formed
1. Development of an IoT based System for automatic toll fee and parking fee collection using RFID technology
2. Development of an software module for vehicles tracking, toll fee analysis, deduction of fee from bank account, SMS notification
